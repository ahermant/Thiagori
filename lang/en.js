Even supermodels are on dating apps.</p><p>We started quickly to talk and it led to endless hilarious conversations on whatsapp (because as you know it, we are also hilarious).</p><p>Sharing the same love for good sarcasms and the same life expectations, we decided to meet.</p><p>When Auri saw Thiago she thought, with a slight disappointment, that he looked much older than what he pretended. Also, he had very long white hair which looked rather silky but was not matching his pictures. She quickly was relieved when she realised that he was actually the other guy behind.</p><p>Even though Thiago was into dance and coconuts and Auri into cheese and burning cars during French strikes, we started to talk and found a strong connexion right away.</p><p>We knew it was the beginning of something meant to last.</p><p>Within a couple of weeks, we had already met each other’s amazing families on video calls and a month after, Thiago was already asking Auri to move in together, especially because he loves Auri’s lasagnas.</p><p>Almost 6 months later, we were moving together. We were even more convinced about our common weirdness and we made more and more projects. Of course, don’t get me wrong, we sometimes argue. Like when Thiago tells Auri that Felipe is funnier than her and that she is only number 2, or like when Auri puts her finger in Thiago’s belly button.</p><p>Since day one we knew this was not only a romance, but the best friendship ever. Except maybe when one of us watches a Netflix serie without the other or if Thiago eats all the cheese in the fridge. But hey, no one is perfect, right?</p><p>Almost 2 years later, Thiago proposed in Brazil surrounded by our 2 families (we were missing Auri’s dad).</p><p>We are so looking forward to starting this new chapter together, and can’t wait to celebrate with all of our favourite people</p><p><br></p>",
